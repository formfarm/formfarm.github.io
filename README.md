# 🐚 hello and welcome 🥬

form farm is a studio and a living archive of creative projects and resources. you can find more about the website on the webpage, [a website with the sound of its own making](https://www.formfarm.org/making-sound.html).

currently it's just an individual effort, but I hope to make this a more collective process. I'll be setting up an email in the future if you want to be in touch.
