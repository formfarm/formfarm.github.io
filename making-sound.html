<h1>A website with the sound of its own making</h1>
<p>In 1961, Robbert Morris made a <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/689665">box</a>. I saw the box in 2016. It is a small wooden box, with no ornament or obvious function, but a beautiful box. I saw no obvious way of opening the box; it reminds me of a vessel for ashes, something eternal, not created with the intention of opening. It also resembles a drawing of a box made from memory, made in the round.</p>
<p>When I approach the box I can hear the ringing of hammers and the sawing of lumber. A refracted recording of material being reshaped, transformed, reassembled. A tree being made into wood being made into box. The means of production laid bare. I find it a bit comical, like having a statue talk back at you. And it makes me wonder, which could be completed first? The recording or the making?</p>
<p>In an effort to demonstrate how this website was constructed, I will represent and compress this process with words, images, and sounds. The website has been an ongoing and evolving project for me, and it is currently living in a folder on my laptop&#39;s local drive.</p>
<p>All of the pages on the site have been handwritten using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown syntax</a>, which are transformed into html files using <a href="">marked</a>. I will then edit the html files to add custom css to style the pages individually. You can view all the source code here, using your browser&#39;s built-in source code viewer and web inspector.</p>
<p>My intention is to construct the website using human-readable documents. By focusing on the mutability of text, the contents of this site can be easily rendered in many forms, including on printed paper or via screen-readers. I find this provides stability, since I know the information will remain accessible no matter how much technology changes, or even if my computer fails (as long as I remember to print it out)! The forced simplicity of this approach also lends itself to less data and energy consumption, on the part of myself and anyone accessing the website. It also leads me to more focused aesthetic and design considerations.</p>
<p>My next plans for the website are to host the files on a small server in my home, to make it accessible from the Web.</p>
<p>You can navigate through the website using its <a href="index.md">index</a>.</p>
